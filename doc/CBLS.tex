\emph{Constraint based local search} (CBLS) is trying to combine the concept of constraint programming and local 
search. Constraint programming gives a natural way of describing a problem and can reuse the global constraint, 
propagators, and search strategies. Local search has concepts such as moves, neighborhood, and metaheuristics that have 
specific implementations for each problem type. Local search offers high quality solution within a relatively short time 
limit. \\ 
The idea of a CBLS framework is to offer global constraint to formulate the problem while local search algorithms are 
used to solve the model. The user can focus on modeling their problem instead of creating and optimizing 
algorithms to solve it. This gives the reusability and formulation power of constraint programming while having the 
performance of local search.   \\ 
To increase efficintcy of local search, new data structures are introduced such as Invariants and oneway constraints.
