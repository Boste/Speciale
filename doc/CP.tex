Constraint programming involves defining variables and constraints like ILP but often a wide range of constraints can 
be used. Constraint programming is declarative programming, that is the program  describe how the desire result 
should be and not the commands or steps to reach it. Constraint programming uses a programming language or framework 
that have procedures implement to solve the problem according to the constraints posted.
