I have been very happy for studying at IMADA and would use this opportunity to thank all of the students here for 
creating this study environment. \\ 
I would especially thank Marco Chiarandini for being my supervisor in this thesis. 
He is always found time to discuss interesting ideas and has provide many suggestions for this thesis. I would also 
like to thank my office ``Dom√¶net'' for supporting me in tough times. \\ 
I am especially grateful for the support Rojin Kianian, Anders Knudsen, and Jonas Camillus has provide. Least but 
certainly not last I am very happy for all the support Lotte Rasmussen has given.
