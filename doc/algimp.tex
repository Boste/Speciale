When a model better suited for local search has been made, the remaining time is used to do local search. The 
algorithms check if the timelimit is reach before each iteration of a search procedure. The best solution found while 
searching is saved in a \class{State} class such that the search can continue but always report the best solution when 
the time limit is reached. \\ 
Three algorithms have been made from combining \class{Neighborhood} classes and search procedures that will be used to 
test efficiency of the framework. The first algorithm uses two \class{TabuSearch} with different 
\class{Neighborhood} classes. When the solution is infeasible \class{TabuSearch} is combined with \class{ConflictOnlyNE} 
to only look at variables that can reduce the number of violations. When the current solution is feasible 
\class{TabuSearch} with a \class{RestrictedFlipNE} class is used. If the number of independent variables are less than 
or equal to 5000 it uses a \class{FlipNeighborhood} class instead. The reason for choosing a subset of the neighborhood 
to examine is to increase the number of iterations made in case the neighborhood is large. \\

The second algorithm for testing is iterated local search using first improvement and random walk \cite[p. 
141-142]{lsbog} with a single flip neighborhood. They idea is to find a local optima fast, and use randomness to escape 
the optima. The random walk chooses a random neighborhood operation and commits that if it is legal. This is repeated 
a number of time depending on the size of the neighborhood. This is done to try to explore many different subspaces 
of the search space $S$. \\

The last algorithm that will be tested uses a minimum conflict heuristic with a single flip neighborhood when the 
current solutions is infeasible. When the current solution is feasible a tabu search with a restricted single flip 
neighborhood is used. \\

Several other algorithms can be made from the \class{Neighborhood} and search procedure classes. Though they can be 
combined in many ways they are not as easily combined as wanted. The \class{Neighborhood} classes can be a mix of 
heuristics and a neighborhood which is not ideal. %The next subsection will discuss this in more detail.
