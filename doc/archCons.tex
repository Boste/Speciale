Constraints are all derived from the same class (\class{Constraint} figure \ref{fig_constraint}) that forces some 
methods to be implemented. All constraints need a priority according to how important the constraint is. The priority 
is given by an positive integer and do not need to be unique but it will help the local search to differentiate between 
infeasible solutions. There is no reason to skip an integer in a sequence since it wont make a difference. It is 
suggested to keep the size of the sequence of priorities lower than 5. \\
An example of a constraint is the \class{Linear} constraint, which is the same as the one used in integer and binary 
programming, equation \ref{equat_linear} is an example of a \class{Linear} constraint. 
\begin{equation}
 c_1: \; 2x_1 + 2x_2 \leq 2  \qquad x_1,x_2 \in \{0,1\}
\end{equation} \label{equat_linear} \noindent
A constraint is posted in the Gecode \class{Space} by \class{GecodeEngine} and later handled in the 
\class{LocalSearchEngine}. The 
constraints are treated differently in the environments and need different parameters and methods for that. The LS 
environment handles constraints through invariants hence an implementation of a constraint needs a method for 
creating the invariants needed in LS. The method \method{createInvariants} creates invariants that 
might be auxiliary variables helpful during local search and one invariant that represents 
if the constraint is violated and the violation degree. The violation degree can be one if violated and zero 
otherwise, or it give a measurement of violated the constraint is. For the linear constraint $c_1$ in equation 
\ref{equat_linear} the violation degree is how much the value of the left hand side must decrease to satisfy the 
constraint. A helpful auxiliary variable is the value of the left hand side such that it does not need to be recomputed 
when computing the violation. \\
The methods \method{canBeMadeOneway} and \method{makeOneway} are used if the constraint can be transformed 
to a oneway constraint hence functionally define one of the variables. Method \method{canBeMadeOneway} returns a 
boolean whether it can be used or not and \method{makeOneway} transforms the constriant into a oneway constraint, 
implemented as an invariant, that defines one of the variables. The only constraint that has been implemented is 
\class{Linear}. 
\subsubsection{Implementation of Linear}
\class {Linear} is a linear constraint $c_j$ with a coefficient hashmap $A(c_j)$ and a vector of variables $X(c_j)$ 
that have some relation to a constant on the right hand side $b(c_j)$. The relation that can be used are: 
$\{\leq,=,\geq,>,<\}$ 
but only the first two ($\leq,=\}$) needs to be managed. If one of the three last is used it is transformed into a 
$\leq$ relation instead. This is done to reduce the number of comparisons later. The change can be done by multiplying 
with $-1$ on each side to change from ``greater'' to ``less'' relation. All coefficients and variables are integer hence 
all strictly less/greater relations can be transformed to a less/greater equal relation by increasing or decreasing 
$b(c_j)$ by 1. \\
The methods \method{canBeMadeOneway} and \method{makeOneway} are covered in section \ref{sec_ls} and only 
\class{Linear} constraints that have ``$=$'' relation can be made oneway constraints. \\ 
The method \method{createInvariants} creates two invariants the first one represents the value of the left hand side in 
the constraint and the other represents the violation degree. The first invariant is a \class{Sum} invariant and is 
described in the next subsection. The second one depends on the relation of the constraint and is either a 
\class{LEQVioaltion} or 
\class{EQVioaltion} that are also describe in the next subsection. \\
For notation if a variable is defined by an invariant it belongs to the set $Y(c_j)$ instead of $X(c_j)$. Algorithm 
\ref{algo_lin} illustrates how the two invariants for \class{Linear} is created. \\
