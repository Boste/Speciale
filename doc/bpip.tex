There exisist several solver for discrete optimization problems such as Cplex, Gurobi, GLPK. These solver can solver 
various other problems aswell. Binary- and integer linear programming can be used to model a wide 
range of problems by posting linear constraints and using and a linear objective function. A linear integer program 
can be writting on the form: 
\begin{align}
 \text{Minimize } & \mathbf{c}^T\mathbf{x} \\ 
 \text{subject to } & A\mathbf{x} \leq \mathbf{b} \\ 
 & \mathbf{x} \in \mathbb{Z}^n
\end{align}
Here $A$ is a $n \times m$ matrix of coefficients, $\mathbf{b} \in \mathbb{R}^m$ and $\mathbf{c} \in 
\mathbb{R}^n$ . \\ 
A solution is an assignment of values to all variables $\mathbf{x}$ and a solution is said to be feasible if all 
constraints are satisfied. The set of feasible solutions consist of integer point in a $n$ dimensional space and the 
point that minimize the objective function is said to be the optimal solution. \\ 
Solving a general integer program or binary program is a NP-hard problem and several techniques are developed for 
solving them. The techniques can be i.e. branch and bound, cutting plane and branch and cut and usually solving an 
auxiliary linear problem as well. \cite[p. 30]{ilp} \\
