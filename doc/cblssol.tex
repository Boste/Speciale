There are different ways of measuring the quality of an solution. For a CSP a feasible solution needs to be found but 
there is not distinguished between feasible solutions.  \\
In a COP the feasible solutions are compared by an objective function that gives the feasible solution a measurement 
of quality. \\ 
There are different ways of differentiating infeasible solution from other solutions, feasible or infeasible. The 
evaluation function is a combination of the objective function and the violated constraints. Each constraint can be 
given a weight and together with the violation degree it contribute to the evaluation function. I.e. a constraint has 
weight ten and a violation degree of three it then contribute 30 to the evaluation function. In this way the search 
priorities to satisfy certain constraints more than other. This method can have the negative effect that it might 
priorities to have all constraint with violation degree over one constraint with very high violation degree. \\ 
Another way it to use a priority for each constraint as a lexicographic ordering, rather satisfy a constraint with high 
priority than any number of constraints with lower priority.
