Comet is an object oriented programming language that uses the modeling language of constraint programming and uses a 
general purpose local search solver. Comet is now an abandoned project, but the architecture used is still of interest. 
The core of the framework are the variables and invariants.
\medskip \\
One layer above the invariants are the differentiable objects that can use the invariants and variables. 
Both constraints and objectives are implemented as differentiable objects. They are called differentiable 
because it is possible to compute how the change of a variable value will affect the differentiable object's values. 
All constraints are implemented using the same interface, which means that all constraint have some methods in common. 
This is especially useful when combining multiple constraints in a constraint system. The constraints can be combined in 
a constraint system that then uses the method from the individual constraints to calculated its own methods. Just like 
the \interface{constraint} interface there exists an \interface{objective} interface. \medskip \\ 
The next layer is where the user models their problem and use the objects mentioned above. Several search procedures 
are implemented. The benefit of this architecture is that the user can focus on modeling the problem 
efficiently on a high level and thereby avoid small implementation mistakes. Using constraint programming inspired 
structure gives the benefit of brief, but very descriptive code. \\ 
The idea of structuring the constraint and invariant as interface is also used in this framework. 



%The core of framework is the incremental store that contains various incremental objects fx. incremental variables. 
%Invariants, also called one-way constraints, are expressions that are defined by incremental variables and a relation 
%of those. An incremental variable $v$ can for instance be expressed as a sum of other variables. The variable $v$ will 
%automatically be updated if one of the other variables changes value. The order in which the invariants are updated 
%can be implemented to achieve higher performance.
