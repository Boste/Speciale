A construction heuristics is used to find an initial candidate solution to a given instance. One of the main things to 
consider when creating a construction heuristic algorithm is the balance between quality of the solution and time 
complexity of the algorithm. The extreme case would be to solve the given instance with a construction heuristic but 
then the main point of local search is lost, which is finding a high quality solution fast. \\ 
The first thing to consider when creating a construction heuristic is whether it has to find a feasible solution or it 
is allowed to find an infeasible solution. The choice depends on how the local search is designed, whether it can reach 
infeasible solutions or not. \\ 
An example of a simple construction heuristic is creating a random candidate solution. For each variable a value 
between its lower and upper bound is chosen uniformly at random. This is a fast construction heuristic $O(n)$ but 
cannot give any guarantee of the quality. Examples of other construction heuristics could be greedy heuristics like 
first fit or best fit. \\ 
Construction heuristics can be tailored to a specific problem type to find a good initial solution depending on 
the problem. It can be beneficial to introduce randomness in the algorithm and rerun it a couple of times to get a 
better initial solution.
