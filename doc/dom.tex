Every time a constraint is posted in the Gecode Solver, Gecode does cheap propagation to reduce the domain 
of the variables in the constriant posted \cite[p. 19.]{MPG:M}. \\ 
When the user request an initial solution to the model, Gecode {\sffamily{Branch}} method is called that 
specify which varialbes to branch on and what values \boste{Default or by the user?}. Then Gecodes \method{status} is 
called that does further propagation on the model before searching for a solution. If the domain of a variable is 
reduced to a single value, the variable is said to be fixed and is assigned that value.
