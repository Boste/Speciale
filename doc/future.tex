\boste{Short description of problems that should be investigated more} \\
\boste{preprocessing :} preprocessing of Cplex and gurobi with Gecode \\ 
\boste{Cycles :} Finding all (elementary) cycles in the dependency digraph and/or finding the smallest set of vertices 
to remove such that the graph is DAG. \\ 
\boste{Integer variables :} How to treat integer variables when they cannot be defined by oneway constraints. \\ 
\boste{Propagation queue :} Finding a datastructure better suited for propagation queues than red-black trees (C++ 
set). \\ 
\boste{Mixed neighborhood :} Find a way to treat both integer and binary variables in local search. \\
\boste{Make ``true'' DFS when creating propagation queues, no revisit of vertices} \\
\boste{Change Constraints to invariants during local search to measure the violation}
