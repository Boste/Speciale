There is many things that can be developed to this framework. Find a way to incorporate Gecode such that is is 
easier to create new constraint. Currently it can only solve instances with integer coefficients because Gecode either 
takes all arguments as integer (and integer variables) or all arguments as float (and float variables). It has not been 
possible to scale the coefficient to integer since it quickly leads to integer overflow. \\ 
It can be extended to handle integer variables as well as binary. This could lead to a wide range of constraints to 
implement and increase the usability of Gecode. To handle integer variable new neighborhoods must be implemented and 
one should think about how to handle models with both binary and integer variables. \\
The \class{Neigborhood} classes is mixed with heuristics and it would be good to separate those, both conceptually and 
for effectiveness in practice. \\
There is currently not much a user can do to influence how the problem should be solved other than a priority for the 
constraints. It could be extended with a priority for the variables as well such that variables depend on other got a 
lower priority. In addition an option class could be implemented giving the user access to change some of the 
parameters in the framework. \\ 
Last but not least the parameters of the local search should be test more throughly which is expected to increase the 
performance of this solver.
