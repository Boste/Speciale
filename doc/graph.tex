There can be many dependencies between variables,invariants and constraints and these dependencies can be illustrated 
by a graph. The graph can be partioned into to parts. The first part consist of a vertex for each variable and two 
vertices $u$ and $v$ are connected if and only if they at least have one constraint in common. The edges can then be 
expressed as the constraints. The second partition of the graph consist of all the invariants. The
