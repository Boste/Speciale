In contrast to integer programming and constraint programming, local search does not do an exhaustive 
search for a solution. Local search is based on making small changes to the current solution and 
see if it can improve and sacrifices the optimality guarantee for performance. \\ 
To create a model for local search a set of variables and a set of constraints for the variables needs to be defined. 
The constraints are either implicit or soft. The variables and implicit constraints define the 
candidate solution and hence the search space $S$.
