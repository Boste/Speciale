In contrast to integer programming and constraint programming, local search does not do an exhaustive 
search for a solution. Local search is based on making small changes to the current solution and 
see if it can improve and sacrifices the optimality guaranty for performance. \\ 
To create a model for local search a set of variables and a set constraints for the variables needs to be defined. The 
constraints are implicit constraints and some might need to be relaxed to soft constraints. The variables and implicit 
constraints define the candidate solution and hence the search space $S$.
