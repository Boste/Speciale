In contrast to integer programming and constraint programming, local search does not do an exhaustive 
search for a solution hence it cannot guaranty to find an optimal solution. Where as integer programming and constraint 
programming does a systematic search to eliminate solution candidates, local search is based on looking at close area 
of the search space and look for improvements there. Local search algorithms sacrifices the optimality guaranty for 
performance. On many problems local search finds high quality solution within a relative search time limit. \\ 
NP-hard problems are very hard to solve optimally if the search space gets large. Integer programming usually works on 
the problem in different ways and can sometimes give bounds on the problem solution. Constraint programming works by 
eliminating some candidate solution and reducing domain of variables. Local search finds a solution and keeps searching 
close by for a better solution. \\
