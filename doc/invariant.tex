Invariants are variables, which value is purely determined by other variables. The variable defined is not necessarily 
one of the variable currently in the system but it can be a new auxiliary variable which value is of interest.  
The invariants all have generic methods that needs to be defined for the different types of invariants. One of these 
methods is for instance \method{getCurrentValue()} that return the value of the invariant. If a variable $v$ 
changes value then the invariants that are defined by $v$ needs to update their current value. This is done 
through the \method{addChange(arguments)} method, \method{calculateDeltaValue()}, and  \method{updateValue()}. They 
informs the invariant something is changed, calculates the change in value and updates the current value respectively. 
Since invariants can be defined by variables that are invariants themselves this can leads to a series of 
updates. Invariants and constraints can built as a directed graph without cycles in 
order to avoid looking at an invariant multiple times when a change is made to a variable. The construction of that 
graph is described in section \ref{updategraph}. \\ 
An example of an invariant is the \method{Sum} invariant that defines an auxiliary variable. The 
\method{Sum} invariant consist of a coefficient set $C$, variable set $V$ and it can have a constant $b$ added. For 
a \method{Sum} invariant $S$ the value is defined as: \\
\begin{equation}
 S = b+ \sum_{\substack{i \in I_S}}  c_i x_i  
\end{equation}



%which value is defined by the sum of the variables and invariant  times their coefficient. 
%Invariants are used to create auxiliary variables based on other variables and/or invariants.
