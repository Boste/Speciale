When creating a model for local search there is several things to consider, most important things to consider are what 
the variables should represent and what constraint should be imposed on them. The choice of variables and constraints 
together with the step function should be such that the delta evaluation can be calculated fast, preferably $O(1)$. The 
step function should be chosen such that the search space can be explored efficiently. One thing to consider is whether 
allowing candidate solution that are infeasible or not, once a feasible solution is found.
