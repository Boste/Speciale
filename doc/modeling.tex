The choice of modeling approach should depend on the nature of the problem. Constraint programming (CP) uses 
constraints to formulate a constraint satisfaction problem (CSP) and often provides short and natural way to 
describe a problem. Constraint programming try to find feasible solutions to a CSP hence it does not 
differentiate the solutions that might exist. One can work around that by creating a function that evaluates a 
solution by a value. Then add the constraint that the function must give a better value than last time. \\

Mixed integer programming (MIP) and Integer programming (IP) are more restricted in the choice of constraints. They can 
only use linear constraints hence the models often tend to be longer in order to formulate a problem. Unlike 
constraint programming both mixed integer programming and integer programming has an objective function that rates the 
quality of a solution. Binary programming (BP) models the same way as MIP and IP but restricts the variables from 
integer to binary. \\
