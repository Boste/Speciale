One-way constraints are constraints that is used to define the value of a single variable. The single variable is made 
as an \class{invariant} and can only change when one of the variables that defines it changes. One-way 
constraints reduces the search space \boste{(which should be discussed before this I guess)} since the variable defined 
by a one-way constraint can only be changed by a move indirectly.
