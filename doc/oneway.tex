One way constraints are constraints that is used to define a single variable. The single variable is made as an 
invariant and can only change when one of the variables or invariants that defines it changes. One way constraints 
reduces the search space (which should be descussed before this I guess) since the variable defined by a oneway 
constraint cannot be changed by a move.
