Oscar is a another CBLS framework implemented in Scala and has drawn inspiration from Comet. It is implemented as a 
backend solver for MiniZinc, MiniZinc is a modeling language to combinatorial problems.  \\ 
OscarR uses invariants and oneway constraints like Comet and uses propagation graphs. OscaR allow the user to define 
variables through oneway constraints and creates more oneway constraints defining variables if possible. The 
propagation graphs are split in a dynamic and static graph. The graphs have the same set of vertices but the 
dynamic has a subset of the edges of the static. In the dynamic graph cycles are not allowedbut they are in 
the static. If a cycles would be formed in the dynamic it is broken. In order to only update each invariant 
once the cycles in the static graph is consider a single vertex of a strongly connected component. \\ 
Their search procedure uses different neighborhoods for independent varibles and implicit constraints. Each variable in 
a model can only be involved in one neighborhood. Some of the neighborhoods are constraints specific meaning they 
are only uses if a specific constraint is used when modeling. \\
