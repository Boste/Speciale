Each time a constraint is posted by a user it is parsed from General Solver to the Gecode Solver. The Gecode solver is 
derived from Gecode Space \boste{Define structure / Space before this} and the constraints parsed is posted in the 
Gecode Solver. Gecode has a large selection of constraints that can be used \cite[p. 58-80]{MPG:M}. Most of the 
constructors of these constraints are overloaded such that they can take different arguments and works with different 
types of variables.
