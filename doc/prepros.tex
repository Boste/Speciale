All constraints that are created are both saved in \class{Storage} and parsed to \class{GecodeSolver}, that is derived 
from Gecode Space. In \class{GecodeSolver} they are posted such that Gecode can be used to find an initial solution. 
Gecode has a large selection of constraints that can be used \cite[p. 58-80]{MPG:M}. Most of the constructors of these 
constraints are overloaded such that they can take different arguments and works with different types of variables.
