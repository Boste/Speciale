Preprocessing and finding an initial solution is handled by Gecode. Each time a constraint is posted by a user it is 
parsed from General Solver to The Gecode Solver. The Gecode solver is derived from Gecode Space \boste{Define 
structure / Space before this} and the constraints parsed is posted in the Gecode Solver.
