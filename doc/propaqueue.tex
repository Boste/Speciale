For each independent variable $x_i$ a propagation queue $q_i$ is made. A propagation queue $q_i$ is an 
topological sorting of invariants that are reachable from the vertex representing $x_i$ in the dependency directed 
graph $G$. The vertices in the propagation queue are ordered according to their time stamp in decreasing 
order which is a topological sorting such that there is no backward pointing arc. \\
The propagation queue $q_i$ is used such that each invariant dependent on the value of $x_i$ is updated at most once if 
the variable changes value. The DDG represents which invariant that are directly affected by a change in variable $x_i$ 
but not the order in which they should be updated. Figure \ref{fig_propqueue} shows the necessity of such an ordering.

If $y_1$ is updated before $y_2$ then it might need to be updated again after $y_2$ is updated hence updated 
twice. In worst case the number of updates performed when updating $x_i$ could be exponential in the number of vertices 
reachable from $x_i$ instead of linear. \\ 
Once the dependency directed graph is a DAG each invariant vertex has been given a time stamp by Tarjans algorithm. 
Propagation queues are implemented as red-black trees without duplicates hence they have insert time complexity 
$O(log(n))$. For each variable vertex $v_i$ in dependency digraph $G$ a depth first search is made. Each vertex 
visited is added to the propagation queue of $v_i$. This gives a time complexity of $O(rlog(r))$ where $r$ is the 
number of reachable vertices from $v_i$.  \medskip \\ 
During local search when a single variable $x_i$ changes value the change propagate through the DDG using 
the ordering from the propagation queue $q_i$. When two or more variable change value the propagation queues can be 
merged into a single queue removing duplicates.  \\ 
Figure \ref{fig_ddgs} and \ref{fig_props} gives an example of creating a propagation queue for a variable based on the 
dependency graph. It is possible to create different propagation queues from the example but we do not differentiate 
between them as long as there is no backward going arc. In this case we have single variable $x_1$ that creates the 
propagation queue $q_1 = [y_2,y_1,y_4,y_3,y_5]$. The idea is to send the changes from $x_1 $ to $y_2$,$y_1$, and $y_4$ 
then go to $y_2$ update its value and send the change to $y_5$. Go to $y_1$, update and send change, go to $y_4$ etc.
