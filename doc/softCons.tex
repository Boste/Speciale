\emph{Soft constraints} are constraints that the CBLS should try to satisfy when making moves. If a 
soft constraint is not satisfied we say it is violated and it contributes to the evaluation function. There are 
different ways of measuring violation in a constraint. One way is a boolean value, zero for not violated and one for 
violated. Another way is measure how much a constraint is violated, \emph{violation degree}, by a function depending on 
the constraint. I.e. for the \textbf{alldifferent(X)} constraint, that is all variables \textbf{X} must have pairwise 
distinct values, it can be the number of variables with the same value as another variable. \\
