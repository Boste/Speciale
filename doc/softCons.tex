\emph{Soft constraints} are constraints that the local search should try to satisfy when making neigborhood operations. 
If a soft constraint is not satisfied we say it is violated and it contributes to the evaluation function. There are 
different ways of measuring the violation in a constraint. One way is a binary value, zero for not violated and one 
for violated. Another way is to use \emph{violation degree}, a measurement of how violated a constraint is, by a 
function depending on the constraint. I.e. for the \textbf{alldifferent(X)} constraint, that is all variables \textbf{X} 
must have pairwise distinct values, it can be the number of variables with the same value as another variable. \\
