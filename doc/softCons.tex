\emph{Soft constraints} are constraints that the CBLS should try to satisfy when making neighborhood operations. If a 
soft constraint is not satisfied we say it is violated and it contributes an amount of violation to the problem. The 
amount of violation contributed depends on the type of constraint and how much it is violated. \\
