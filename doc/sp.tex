Three different search procedures are implemented; first improvement, best improvement, and random walk. \\ 
First improvement look at neighbor solutions until a solution better than the current is found \boste{solution better 
than other?} and then make the move to reach that solution and returns true. When the search reaches a local optima no 
improving move can be found and first improvement returns false. As an alternative if no 
improving solution is found a move to solution of same quality could be made, called a sidewalk. It might be an 
improving solution can be found after a sidewalk. If sidewalks are allowed there must be some restriction to the 
sidewalks to prevent cycling through the same solution over and over. For instance this could be forbidding a number of 
consecutive sidewalks. The local optima could be reach very fast hence first improvement need to be complimented with 
other search procedures to continue the search. \\ 
Best improvement explores the whole neighborhood of the current solution and commits the move that gives the best 
improvement. It might take more time to explorer the neighborhood than first improvement but often find a 
better move than first improvement. If no improving move is found it does not commit a move and returns false. Like 
first improvement sidewalks could be allowed. \\ 
The neighborhood of a solution depends on the choice of move and heuristics applied to the neighborhood. The 
neighborhood implemented is \boste{are}
