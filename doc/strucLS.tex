Once an initial solution to the constraint satisfaction optimization problem (COP) has been found the model 
is transformed to create a model suited for local search. Two new datastructures structures are introduced 
in this section, dependency directed graph in subsection \ref{sec_ddg} and propagation queue in subsection 
\ref{sec_propaqueue}. 
\\
The dependency directed graph is used to handle dependencies of invariants when a 
variable changes value. A propagation queue $q_i$ is created for each variable $x_i$ that gives an ordering of the 
invariants reachable from  $x_i$ in the dependency directed graph. \\
%When a variable $x$ changes value other variables dependent on the value of $x$ will need to be updated. To 
%update those variables and invariants a directed graph $G=(V,A)$ is made, called dependency directed graph, 
%\emph{DDG}. 
%The vertices $V$ either represent a variable, an invariant or a constraint. \\  
%When one or more variables change value they propagate their change to the invariants pointed in $G$ that might point 
%to other invariants and propagate their changes to them. We only want to visit each vertex in the graph $G$ at most 
%one 
%time when making changes to on or more variables to increase performance. For each variable used in 
%the local search a \emph{propagation queue} $q$ is made. A propagation queue is the order of which invariant to update 
%when the associated variable changes value. \boste{Not quite happy about the description here} \medskip \\
The model is simplified by defining some of the variables by transforming the functional constraints into oneway 
constraints using the algorithms implemented in the respective constraints. When a variable is defined by a oneway 
constraint it is transformed into an invariant since its value is dependent on other variables and/or invariants. \\ 
The only constraint implemented, \class{Linear}, is used as an example for creating oneway constraints.
