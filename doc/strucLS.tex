Once an initial solution to the problem has been found by Gecode the model is transformed to create a model better 
suited for local search. The procedure can be split in several steps before the local search can begin. 
\begin{enumerate}
 \item Try to define integer variables by one-way constraints
 \item Define invariants for the constraints
 \item Create a dependency directed graph for variables and invariants
 \item Create propagation queue for variables
 \item Initialize the invariants
 \item Initialize the constraints
 \item Initialize the objective function
\end{enumerate}
