Once an initial solution to the constraint satisfaction problem (CSP) has been found by Gecode the model is transformed 
to create a model better suited for local search, a CBLS model. Two new structures \boste{concepts, objects? Not sure 
what to call them} are introduced in this section, dependency directed graph \boste{directed dependency graph?} in 
subsection \ref{sec_ddg} and propagation queue in subsection \ref{sec_propaqueue}.  The dependency directed graph is 
used to update invariants dependent when a variable or invariant changes value. A propagation queue $q_i$ is created 
for each variable $x_i$ and it gives an ordering of the invariants directly or indirectly dependent on $x_i$. \\
%When a variable $x$ changes value other variables dependent on the value of $x$ will need to be updated. To 
%update those variables and invariants a directed graph $G=(V,A)$ is made, called dependency directed graph, 
%\emph{DDG}. 
%The vertices $V$ either represent a variable, an invariant or a constraint. \\  
%When one or more variables change value they propagate their change to the invariants pointed in $G$ that might point 
%to other invariants and propagate their changes to them. We only want to visit each vertex in the graph $G$ at most 
%one 
%time when making changes to on or more variables to increase performance. For each variable used in 
%the local search a \emph{propagation queue} $q$ is made. A propagation queue is the order of which invariant to update 
%when the associated variable changes value. \boste{Not quite happy about the description here} \medskip \\
The following changes to the model are made before the local search can begin. 
\begin{itemize}
 \item Define integer variables by oneway constraints
 \item Define binary variables by oneway constraints 
 \item Create auxiliary invariants for the remaining constraints
 \item Create a dependency directed graph
 \item Create propagation queue for all non-fixed and non-defined variables
%\item Initialize the invariants
% \item Initialize the constraints
% \item Initialize the objective function
\end{itemize}
When a variable is defined by a oneway constraint it is transformed into an invariant since its value is dependent on 
other variables and invariants.
