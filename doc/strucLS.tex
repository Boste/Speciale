Once an initial solution to the problem has been found by Gecode the model is transformed to create a model better 
suited for local search. \boste{talk briefly about DDG and propagation queue (what are they used for)} procedure can 
be split in several steps before the local search can begin. 
\begin{itemize}
  \item Define variables by one-way constraints
 \item Create invariants for the remaining constraints
 \item Create a dependency directed graph for variables and invariants
 \item Create propagation queue for all non fixed variables
%\item Initialize the invariants
% \item Initialize the constraints
% \item Initialize the objective function
\end{itemize}
