The purpose of this solver is to combine the simplicity of constraint programming formulation with the 
efficiency local search. Constraint programming sometimes offers a natural way to write problem formulations that can 
lead to very short and precise formulation. Local search is effective at searching for an improvement of a current 
solution. \\ 
This solver is roughly split into three parts, one for formulating the problem, one for finding an initial solution and 
a part for improving the current solution. The user needs to define variables and constraints for the problem and 
give and need to specify an objective for optimization. The formulation given by the user is then parsed to a 
constraint programming solver Gecode and Local search framework. Gecode is used to find an initial solution that the 
local search framework will try to improve with regard to the objective given by the user.
