The purpose of this solver is to combine the simplicity of constraint programming formulation with the 
efficiency local search. Constraint programming sometimes offers a natural way to write problem formulations that can 
lead to very short and precise formulation. Local search is effective at searching for an improvement of a current 
solution. \\ 
This solver is roughly split into three parts, one for formulating the problem, one for finding an initial solution and 
a part for improving the current solution. For finding an initial solution the constraint programming solver Gecode is 
used.
