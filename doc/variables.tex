The  \class{Variable} only consist of short setter and getter methods. Each variable has a unique increasing id in the 
ordered by the time of creation. Their current value must be within their domain, given by a lower and 
upper bound. Each variable has a flag that tell if the domain size of the variable is equal to one and a flag that 
tell if it is defined by a oneway constraint. They have a counter for the number of constraints and oneway constraints 
they participate in. \\
