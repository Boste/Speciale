Models contain a set of $n$ variables $X = \{ x_1, x_2, \dots , x_n \} $ and let $I = \{1,2,\dots, i, \dots , n\}$ be 
the set of indices of $X$. Each variable $x_i \in X$ has a \emph{domain} $D(x_i) \in D$ where $D$ is the Cartesian 
product of $n$ domains $D =  D_1 \times D_2 \times \dots\times D_n $ such that $x_i \in D_i$. The variables $x_i \in X$ 
of the models that will be discussed in this thesis all have their domain restricted to a finite discrete domain $D_i 
\subseteq \mathbb{Z}\ : \: \forall i$.  The value of a variable $x$ is denoted $V(x)$. We say a variable is 
independent if the value is allowed to change within its domain in contrast to a dependent variable that only changes 
when other variable changes. We will denote with the letter $y$ variables whose domain is the binary set $\{0,1\}$.
