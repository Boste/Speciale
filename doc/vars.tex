Models contains a set of $n$ variables $X = \{ x_1, x_2, \dots , x_n \} $. Each 
variable $x_i \in X$ has a \emph{domain} $D(x_i) \in D$ where $D$ is the cartisian produkt of n domains $D = 
 D_1 \times D_2 \times \dots\times D_n $ such that $x_i \in D_i$. The variables $x_i \in X$ of the models that will be 
discussed in this thesis all have their domain restricted to a finite discrete domain $D_i \subseteq \mathbb{Z}\ : \: 
\forall i$ \boste{should i declare a set $I = \{1,2,\dots , n\}$?}. The value of a variable $x$ is denoted $V(x)$ and 
we will denote integer variables as $y_i \in Y \subseteq X$.
