Models contains variables $V$ that is a n-tuple of variables $V = \langle v_1, v_2, \dots , v_n \rangle $. Each 
variable $v_i \in V$ has a domain $D(v_i) \in D$ where $D$ is an n-tuple of domains $D = \langle D_1, D_2, \dots , D_n 
\rangle $ such that $v_i \in D_i$. The variables $v_i \in V$ of the models that will be discussed in this paper all 
have their domain restricted to $D_i \subseteq \mathbb{Z}\ : \: \forall \ D_i \in D$ \boste{Does not look quite nice 
}. Hence the all the variables are discrete and can be incremented in small steps. \\
From now on $y_i \in Y \subseteq V$ will denote integer variable while $x_i \in X \subseteq V$ 
denotes binary variables.
