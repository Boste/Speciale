Models contain a set of $n$ variables $X = \{ x_1, x_2, \dots , x_n \} $ Let $I = \{1,2,\dots , n\}$ be the set of 
indices of $X$. Each variable $x_i \in X$ has a \emph{domain} $D(x_i) \in D$ where $D$ is the Cartesian product of $n$ 
domains $D =  D_1 \times D_2 \times \dots\times D_n $ such that $x_i \in D_i$. The variables $x_i \in X$ of the models 
that will be discussed in this thesis all have their domain restricted to a finite discrete domain $D_i \subseteq 
\mathbb{Z}\ : \: \forall i$. The value of a variable $x$ is denoted $V(x)$ and 
we will denote with the letter $y$ variables whose domain is the binary set $\{0,1\}$.
