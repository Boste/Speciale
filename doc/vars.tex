Models contains variables $X$ that is a set of $n$ variables $X = \{ x_1, x_2, \dots , x_n \} $. Each 
variable $x_i \in X$ has a \emph{domain} $D(x_i) \in D$ where $D$ is an n-tuple of domains $D = \langle D_1, D_2, \dots 
, D_n 
\rangle $ such that $x_i \in D_i$. The variables $x_i \in X$ of the models that will be discussed in this thesis all 
have their domain restricted toa finite descrete domain $D_i \subseteq \mathbb{Z}\ : \: \forall \ D_i \in D$. The value 
of a variable $x$ is denoted $V(x)$ and we will denote integer variables as $y_i \in Y \subseteq X$.
